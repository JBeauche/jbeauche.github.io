        <h5>What is zootherapy?</h5>
        <p>
          Zootherapy, an alternative form of therapy, has gained recognition
          within the medical community and is becoming more prevalent. The
          animal involved in the therapy session serves as a non-judgmental
          facilitator in the relationship, promoting openness and helping
          individuals achieve their goals. Zootherapy emphasizes acceptance and
          kindness throughout the therapeutic process.
        </p>
        <h5>Who can benefit from this service?</h5>
        <p>
          Anyone with a cognitive, affective or social disorder such as ASD,
          Tourette's, intellectual disability, behavioural disorder, attachment
          disorder, developmentally delayed child, dementia, as well as
          post-traumatic stress disorder.
        </p>
        <h5>Our Services</h5>
        <p>We offer individual or group sessions.</p>
        <p>
          Our approach involves creating a personalized plan for each client,
          regardless of their age, with clear objectives for the short, medium,
          and long term. If a client already has an intervention plan, we can
          adapt it as needed or continue in the same direction. We provide
          regular reports to track the client's progress and adjust their plan
          accordingly. In some cases, we may need to reassess the client's needs
          a few times a year to ensure we stay up to date with their progress.
