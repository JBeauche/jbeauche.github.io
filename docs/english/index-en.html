          <h3>Josée Lemaire</h3>
          <h5>Owner</h5>
          <div class="justify">
            <p>
              Ever since she was young, Josée has had a deep passion for the
              equestrian world. She became the proud owner of her own horse at
              the age of 14 and took it upon herself to start and train it in
              dressage. By the time she turned 17, Josée had already gained
              extensive experience as the stable manager of 10 Standardbred
              racehorses. Her duties included breeding management, grooming, and
              training.
            </p>
            <p>
              Josée put her love for horses on hold to start a family with her
              husband, who served as a pilot in the Canadian Air Force. Her
              professional background has always been centered around sales and
              customer service. She studied computer networking and worked at
              Village Vacances Valcartier in various departments, including call
              center, corporate sales, tour operation, website management,
              networking, marketing, filming, camping, events, and food services
              management. Josée continued her career in Ontario, where she
              played a crucial role in preparing and opening the Calypso
              Waterpark. As the manager of sales and guest services, she was
              responsible for overseeing the computer system, website, sales and
              administration team, call center, reception, souvenir shop, and
              animation. Through her experiences, Josée developed a strong sense
              of discipline, multitasking abilities, and prioritization skills,
              which have helped shape her character.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was in 2014 that she started the company Vintage Oasis Farm
              following the death of her husband suffering from post-traumatic
              stress disorder. Loving to be surrounded by her animals who help
              her manage her pain and suffering, she began this adventure of
              helping animals and humans following traumas suffered. The company
              started by rescuing retired horses from racing, then included the
              breeding of Warmblood horses as well as Weimaraner dogs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Her ultimate aspiration is to aid individuals in uncovering the
              enchantment of therapy through equine interaction, a practice that
              has aided her family in overcoming numerous losses and hardships.
              Josée specializes in the desensitization of horses and working
              with horses with behavioural problems. She offers riding lessons
              that prioritize the horse's well-being and emphasizes
              communication between the rider and the horse.
