          <h3>Josée Lemaire</h3>
          <h5>Owner</h5>
          <div class="justify">
            <p>
              Ever since she was young, Josée has had a deep passion for the
              equestrian world. She became the proud owner of her own horse at
              the age of 14 and took it upon herself to start and train it in
              dressage. By the time she turned 17, Josée had already gained
              extensive experience as the stable manager of 10 Standardbred
              racehorses. Her duties included breeding management, grooming, and
              training.
            </p>
            <p>
              Josée put her love for horses on hold to start a family with her
              husband, who serves as a pilot in the Canadian Air Force. Her
              professional background has always been centered around sales and
              customer service. She studied computer networking and worked at
              Village Vacances Valcartier in various departments, including call
              center, corporate sales, tour operation, website management,
              networking, marketing, filming, camping, events, and food services
              management. Josée continued her career in Ontario, where she
              played a crucial role in preparing and opening the Calypso
              Waterpark. As the manager of sales and guest services, she was
              responsible for overseeing the computer system, website, sales and
              administration team, call center, reception, souvenir shop, and
              animation. Through her experiences, Josée developed a strong sense
              of discipline, multitasking abilities, and prioritization skills,
              which have helped shape her character.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was in 2014 that she started the company Vintage Oasis Farm
              following the death of her husband suffering from post-traumatic
              stress disorder. Loving to be surrounded by her animals who help
              her manage her pain and suffering, she begins this adventure of
              helping animals and humans following traumas suffered. The company
              began by rescuing retired horses from racing, then included the
              breeding of Warmblood horses as well as Weimaraner dogs. Josée
              specializes in the desensitization of horses and working with
              horses with behavioural problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Her ultimate aspiration is to aid individuals in uncovering the
              enchantment of therapy through equine interaction, a practice that
              has aided her family in overcoming numerous losses and hardships.
              She offers riding lessons that prioritize the horse's well-being
              and emphasizes communication between the rider and the horse.

            Chloe has been horseback riding for the majority of her life. From
            humble beginnings in Saint-Lazare, Chloe grew as a rider and
            horsewoman under the watchful eyes of Christian and Laurence Kieffer
            out of Kieffer Stables. Chloe competed locally on regional circuits
            in both the equitations and the jumpers. Since then, she has gone on
            to win numerous classes with her OTTB mare, Pink Lily, whom she
            trained herself. She has attended clinics with countless big name
            riders including Francois Lamontagne and Hyde Moffat.

            teach the love of horses to all that she meets, sharing her passion
            with others both in and out of the saddle. As a trainer, Chloe takes
            the same approach with her horses, training young horses and
            restarting thoroughbreds into their new careers.

            Maya has a diverse background working horses starting from a young
            age while living in Khartoum, Sudan with rescue cart horses and
            horses saved from the track. Upon returning to Canada, she spent her

            region of British Columbia – retraining and fitnessing horses from
            often difficult pasts. She used her inquisitive nature to instill
            confidence in horses and riders, finding a passion for creating
            strong relationships between them. She focuses on creating trust
            between horse and rider, and strengthening intuitional ways of
            communicating while building confident riding skills.
