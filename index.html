        Vintage Oasis Farm is a private family oriented Boarding, Breeding & Training facility which focuses on foundation training across the English disciplines. 
        Our riding lesson program focuses on a neutral posture that prevents blocking the horsesâ€™ movements, enabling a softer contact with the horse. We offer a range of services that includes:

            <li>Lease and half-lease (hunter, jumper, dressage);</li>
            <li>English riding lessons (beginner, intermediate/advanced, up to level 3 dressage, and hunter/jumper at the silver level);</li>
            <li>Horse starting, training, and rehabilitation board;</li>
            <li>Sale of horses performing in various English disciplines and levels;</li>
            <li>Indoor and outdoor board;</li>
            <li>Possibility to compete in horse shows.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our mission is to provide you piece of mind by providing optimal care to every horse with their health and well-being as our top priority. </p>
